Bear in mind, my people,
That the only thing that is constant is change, yu know.

Through the process of time there must be change
Many aspects of life will get rearrange
Evolution of thought is so very strange
From a gun, to a target, to a shooting range
Your actions will determine what you're thinking of
Whether it be death or one perfect love
Whether it be peace or the push and shove
You have to grab righteousness with your grippy glove
Let us unify and be determine
And let that fire inside keep on burning
and let the children of the earth keep on learning
Everlasting love it's for it we're learning.

It's a different time, it's a different age
It's a different set, it's a different stage
It's a different book, it's a different page
Still we must love the black and white and even beige.

It's a different time, it's a different age
It's a different set, it's a different stage
It's a different book, it's a different page
Still we must love the black and white and even beige.

Devotional service comes through actions
Everything in life has reactions
Remember to praise up the Most High,
Remember love is there for I and I.

The ancient is hardly seen in Babylon,
But what I never see I and I know lives on
Because inside of me I feel the vibration
No temptation should break your concentration
Life is a testimony to the absolute,
There is no discrimination in this ghetto youth
Fornication and hate it will be rebuked
Chase the wicked man away with the drums and flute
We are living life to make it better
The places which are dry to make it wetter
Life is not a game like pool or checkers
I represent the one who holds the scepter

It's a different time, it's a different age
It's a different set, it's a different stage
It's a different book, it's a different page
Still we must love the black and white and even beige.

Devotional service comes through actions
Everything in life has reactions
Remember to praise up the Most High,
Remember love is there for I and I.

Love and happy works will bring purity
Treating everyone the same will bring liberty
The level you will reach is divinity
The fullness is the goal not partiality
No matter what is done the love will spread
To the natty, to the afro, to the baldhead
To the Rasta, to the in between and fake dread
From Germany to India back to Frederiksted
Other races of the earth I never despise
First the black have to organize and centralize
Let us throw away the trash and remove the flies
Wickedness will never reign it will always die

It's a different time, it's a different age
It's a different set, it's a different stage
It's a different book, it's a different page
Still we must love the black and white and even beige.

Yes, so bear in mind, people,
That the only thing that is constant is change, all right.
So yes, be like the tree planted by the rivers,
Love the waters from the Most High.
